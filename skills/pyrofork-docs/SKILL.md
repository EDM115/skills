# Pyrofork Documentation Skill

This skill is a reusable, documentation-first operating guide for Pyrofork.
Use it to implement features, answer questions, debug issues, and generate correct examples **without needing the full docs site**.

## Core operating rules

1. Prefer asynchronous usage (`async def`, `await`, `async with Client(...)`) unless a clear sync requirement exists.
2. Treat `Client` lifecycle explicitly:
   - one-shot scripts: `async with Client(...)`
   - long-running bots: decorators/handlers + `app.run()`
3. Handle API failures explicitly; never swallow broad `RPCError` without logging/feedback.
4. For update routing, design filters + groups intentionally (`group`, propagation control).
5. Keep session handling safe: never run multiple processes against the same `.session` file.

## Fast task routing

Pick reference files based on task type:

- Setup, auth, invocation basics → `references/getting-started.md`
- Handlers, filters, propagation, plugin architecture → `references/updates-and-filters.md`
- Raw API, formatting, storage, proxy, scheduling, performance, test mode → `references/advanced-topics.md`
- Errors, flood waits, session/database/network pitfalls → `references/troubleshooting.md`
- API surface navigation (handlers/decorators/enums/errors/examples) → `references/reference-map.md`
- Complete Topic Guides (full self-contained content from `docs/source/topics/*.rst`) → `references/topics-complete.md`
- Complete FAQ (full self-contained content from `docs/source/faq/*.rst`) → `references/faq-complete.md`

## Canonical implementation defaults

- Installation:
  - `pip install -U pyrofork`
  - recommended acceleration: `pip install -U tgcrypto-pyrofork`
- Minimum startup shape:
  - instantiate `Client("session_name", api_id=..., api_hash=...)` for first auth
  - after successful auth, session can usually be reused with just `Client("session_name")`
- Flood wait strategy:
  - catch `FloodWait` and sleep `e.value` seconds
- Handler registration preference:
  - ergonomic static code: decorators (`@app.on_message(...)`)
  - dynamic/runtime behavior: `add_handler(...)` / `remove_handler(...)`

## Output quality bar when using this skill

When producing Pyrofork code/examples:

- Include correct imports (`Client`, `filters`, handler classes, `errors` as needed)
- Keep async/sync semantics internally consistent (no mixed `await` mistakes)
- Mention session naming implications when relevant
- Mention account model constraints when relevant:
  - file IDs are account-bound (except sticker IDs)
  - user/bot both require API ID/hash during initial auth
- For troubleshooting answers, provide likely root cause + concrete fix path

## Known sharp edges to always account for

- Calling `.stop()`, `.restart()`, `.add_handler()`, `.remove_handler()` from inside a running handler can deadlock unless `block=False` is used where supported.
- Slow or unstable networks often appear as socket/timeout/reset errors.
- `PEER_ID_INVALID` often means wrong id type, not-yet-met peer, or inaccessible chat.
- `sqlite3.OperationalError: database is locked` usually means concurrent access to one session DB.

## Reusable response structure for Pyrofork tasks

For implementation/debug requests, respond in this order:

1. Minimal diagnosis (what class of issue/task this is)
2. Recommended Pyrofork pattern (async lifecycle + handlers/filters/error model)
3. Ready-to-run code skeleton
4. Pitfalls and verification checklist

## Scope boundary

This skill covers Pyrofork usage patterns and Telegram MTProto-facing behavior.
For third-party voice call libraries (`pytgcalls`, `tgcalls`) provide integration guidance only; avoid pretending these APIs are native to Pyrofork.
